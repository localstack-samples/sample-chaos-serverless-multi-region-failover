# Chaos Engineering with LocalStack

Chaos engineering with LocalStack presents a proactive approach to building resilient systems by introducing controlled disruptions.
This versatile practice varies in its application; for software developers, it might mean application behavior and error handling, for architects, ensuring the robustness of system design, and for operations teams, examining the reliability of infrastructure provisioning.
By integrating chaos experiments early in the development cycle, teams can uncover and address potential weaknesses, forging systems that withstand turbulent conditions.

This repo contains various samples that demonstrate the capabilities of LocalStack Chaos Engineering tool suite.
It suppliments the documentation available [here](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/chaos-engineering/).
